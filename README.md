In this course, we explore the use of R programming to construct data visualizations. The course follows <a href="https://socviz.co/"> Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction </a> by Kieran Healy and the course introduction can be found here [<a href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/seminar_1/"> Seminar 1 </a>].

Author: Sally Marcellina Yeo
Date: r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B %Y')

Overview
This project analyzes the Singapore HDB resale market trends from 1990 to the present. The analysis uses a range of data visualization techniques to provide insights into how various factors influence the market, such as:

Flat types
Location
Remaining lease years
Regulatory measures
Economic factors (e.g., interest rates)
The report highlights how significant economic events (like the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis and the 2007 Global Financial Crisis) and government interventions impacted HDB resale prices.

Key Features
Line Plots: Visualize the time-series data for average prices per square foot (psf) across different time periods.
Bar Charts: Show transaction volumes over time to reflect market activity.
Scatter Plots: Analyze the correlation between average psf prices and factors such as remaining lease years and flat types.
Map Plots: Present the average psf prices geographically across different towns in Singapore.
Insights
Economic Impact: Regulatory measures and economic variables like interest rates have a strong influence on the resale HDB market.
Price Determinants: Flat type, age, and location significantly affect the resale prices.
Government Measures: Government interventions during key financial crises played a critical role in stabilizing prices.
